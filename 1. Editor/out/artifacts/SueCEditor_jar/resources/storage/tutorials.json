[{"id":1,"title":"Introduction","description":"Welcome to SueC tutorials!\n\nThese tutorials are useful for learning the basics of SueC programming language, an educational programming language aimed to be close to the pseudocode. It uses elements ans structures similar to other programming languages like C and Python. \nEach statement ends with a semicolon and no curly brackets are needed. ","task":"For first, please write this in the code area:\n\nwrite \"Hello\";","answer":"Hello"},{"id":2,"title":"Variables - Integers","description":"Variables are the key elements of a programming language. These are used for storing different information in memory. The main structure of the statement is:\n\u003ctype\u003e \u003cvar_name\u003e ;\n\u003ctype\u003e - int for integer or string for string;\n\u003cvar_name\u003e - one letter of the English alphabet. The camel-case counts.","task":"Define an integer variable a with value 4 and display it using \"write\" command.","answer":"4"},{"id":3,"title":"Variables - Strings","description":"Same as before, variables can also store strings. The good part is that the strings have their memory already allocated, once the variable is created and assigned.\nThe assignment of a string is different - using the \"copy\" command:\n\ncopy \u003cdest\u003e \u003csource\u003e;","task":"Create a string variable and assign the string \"Hello\". After that, display on the screen.","answer":"Hello"},{"id":4,"title":"Integers","description":"Integers are used for mathematical operations in computer programming, as they are the most simple operations implemented in computer science. These operations are:\n- addition: a+b\n- subtraction: a-b\n- multiplication: a*b\n- division: a/b","task":"Display the addition of 3 and 4.","answer":"7"},{"id":5,"title":"Strings","description":"Strings are used frequently in programming languages mostly for storing data and creating objects for databases or displaying them in different applications. Operations that are specified in SueC are:\n- copy \u003cdest\u003e \u003csource\u003e - copies the source string into the destination string\n- unite \u003cdest\u003e \u003csource\u003e - united the source string with the destination string\n- compare \u003cstr_1\u003e \u003cstr_2\u003e - compares the strings. \n- length \u003cstr\u003e - it returns the length of the string","task":"Unite \"Hello\" and \"World\" and display it on the screen.","answer":"HelloWorld"}]
